</details>

# Requirements
<details>
<summary>

### General
</summary>

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to ([why?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-system-calls-expensive-in-operating-systems))
- Write a `README` with the description of your project
- You should have an `AUTHORS` file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format, see `Docker`

### GitHub
</summary>

_*There should be one project repository per group. If you and your partner have a repository with the same name in both your accounts, you risk a 0% score. Add your partner as a collaborator. *_

### Output
</summary>

- Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as `sh` (`/bin/sh`) as well as the exact same error output.
- The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your `argv[0]` (See below)

Example of error with `sh`:
```
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```
Same error with your program `hsh`:
```
$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```

### Compilation
</summary>

Your shell will be compiled this way:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>

### Testing
</summary>

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```

### Checks
</summary>

The Checker will be released at the end of the project (1-2 days before the deadline). We strongly encourage the entire class to work together to create a suite of checks covering both regular tests and edge cases for each task. See task 8. Test suite.
